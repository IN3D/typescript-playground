Stresstesting JS ecosystem in TS

---

Things TypeScript must satisfy for use:
 - Can be setup with Webpack
 - Can be setup with Karma
 - Can be used with React
 - TSX isn't a pain in the balls
 - Can be used with Cucumber tests
 - TsConfig and TsLint are reasonable to setup
 - The libraries I want to use have typings defined
